## Work experience

**Research associate (Dec. 2021-present)**

- Institute for Manufacturing, University of Cambridge
- **Supervisor:** Prof. Ajith Parlikad
- Developed discrete-event simulation models and web dashboards for predicting hospital bed occupancy of COVID-19 patients, for capacity planning and to support recovery of selected non-Covid services.
- Developed discrete-event simulation models and web dashboards for process modelling in a histopathology lab, for KPI prediction, resource planning, and process optimisation.
- Current activities:
    - Further development of the above.
    - Set the foundation for developing hospital digital twins, deepening understanding of hospital operations, asset management, and patient outcomes.

**Research Associate (2020-2021), Research Fellow (2018-2020), Postdoctoral Fellow (2016-2018)**

- City University of Hong Kong
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Eric W. M. Wong
- Assisted in the writing of grant applications and project reports, especially in the area of healthcare operations management.
- Developed analytical and simulation models for the evaluation, and optimization of intensive care networks in Hong Kong and other metropolitan cities.
- Developed stochastic models for infectious disease.
- Developed simulation and analytical approximation methods for blocking probability in overflow loss system models, including machine learning-based methods, with applications in various telecommunications and service systems.
- Mentored undergraduate students on the completion of their final year projects.
Instructed final-year undergraduate students on writing simulation programs for stochastic system models.

**Co-lecturer, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa (Jul-Sep 2021)**

- Co-lecturer of the capstone course “Design Project” on engineering design for students in Electrical and Information Engineering.
- I was invited to co-lecture this course thanks to my previous collaboration with Prof. Anton van Wyk on epidemiological modelling for COVID-19.
- Students choosing our selected topic would need to design a simple epidemiological model for COVID-19, analyze possible tipping points leading to an out-of-control local epidemic, and design an early-warning system to avoid hitting these tipping points.

## Education
